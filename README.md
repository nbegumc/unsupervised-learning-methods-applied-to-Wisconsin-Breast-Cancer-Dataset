# Unsupervised Learning Methods Applied to Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

This analysis aims at uncovering some hidden patterns by applying three different unsupervised learning methods: PCA, K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical clustering. <br>

Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset can be obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. <br>
